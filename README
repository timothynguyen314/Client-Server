CLIENT_SERVER builds a basic client/server relationship, where a client takes input from the keyboard, where they will be run as shell commands on a server, and the output will be returned from the server to the client via socket.
This program can be tested by first running server in one terminal window with a designated port#, and then running client in another terminal window with the same port#.
An encrypt option is supported to encrypt data being passed between client and server.
A log option records all data sent from and received by the client, and is useful for testing encryption.
